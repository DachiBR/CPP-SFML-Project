# CPP-SFML-Project

Hello, This is your first C++ SFML Game Project at IBSU.

Main Idea:

Shoot the bullet through the gap between the red barriers.

Rules:

The Player Is starting game with 0 points, The player is blue rectangle .

This rectangle is moving up and down and you can shoot the balls by pressing space button.

If you hit one of the red barriers the game ends, You must try aim bullet to the gap between the barriers. If player gets bullet the rough gap 1 time he/she gets 10 points.

After dying the player can see how many points he/she got.

To compile code write: " g++ main.cpp -o game -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system " And then write " ./game " to start the game.
